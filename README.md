# Data Engineering and Visualization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying data engineering and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights from the Zomato dataset. The aim is to simulate a complete data analysis process, including data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory and statistical analysis, visualization, and results communication. We wanted to answer in-depth research questions about the Food Industry in Bangalore.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Examined the dataset to identify missing values, data types, and anomalies.
   - Documented patterns or inconsistencies for further analysis.

2. **Formulating Research Questions:**
   - Developed specific, impactful questions that guided the analysis and visualization process.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handled missing data using appropriate techniques.
   - Identified and addressed outliers to maintain data quality.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Created diverse visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to highlight key patterns and trends.

5. **Insight Communication:**
   - Presented our findings clearly and effectively, combining data-driven insights with visual storytelling.
