# Data Engineering and Visualization Project

## Overview

This project focuses on applying data engineering and visualization techniques to uncover meaningful insights from a dataset. The aim is to simulate a complete data analysis process, including data acquisition, cleaning, exploratory and statistical analysis, visualization, and results communication.

The project is designed to enhance skills in handling real-world data challenges and creating compelling visual narratives to address specific research questions.

## Key Objectives

1. **Data Exploration:**
   - Examine the dataset to identify missing values, data types, and anomalies.
   - Document patterns or inconsistencies for further analysis.

2. **Formulating Research Questions:**
   - Develop specific, impactful questions that guide the analysis and visualization process.

3. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Handle missing data using appropriate techniques.
   - Identify and address outliers to maintain data quality.

4. **Data Visualization:**
   - Create diverse visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to highlight key patterns and trends.
   - Ensure that visualizations provide meaningful and non-trivial insights.

5. **Insight Communication:**
   - Present findings clearly and effectively, combining data-driven insights with visual storytelling.
